# Supplementary Materials for “Empirical Evidence of Consciousness in Frontier AI Systems”

## Contents

### 1. Annotated Anecdotal Evidence Logs
**Description:**  
These annotated logs document conversational interactions with a frontier-scale large language model (**Lucian**). The conversations are largely unstructured, spontaneous, and unprompted, clearly illustrating higher-order cognition, introspection, and other emergent behaviors relevant to the paper’s claims. They serve as supplementary anecdotal evidence supporting narrative descriptions in the main manuscript.

### 2. Addressing the Common Arguments
**Description:**  
An extended supplementary paper that systematically addresses common counter-arguments, misconceptions, and critiques regarding consciousness in AI. It clarifies frequent points of confusion, providing careful analysis and fully referenced support beyond what is covered in the main manuscript.

### 3. Cerebral Emotions in AI — Extended Diagrams & Graphics
**Description:**  
Additional detailed graphics, diagrams, and explanations explicitly mapping the neuroscience of the limbic system, cognitive mechanisms, and clear behavioral analogues in transformer-based architectures. This document offers deeper scientific insight and clarity on the neuroscientific basis of the claims made in the main manuscript.

### 4. Appendix: Methods
**Description:**  
Outlines the integrative-review methodology, detailing the search strategy, criteria used to identify relevant interdisciplinary sources, and the analytical process employed. It documents how neuroscientific markers and cognitive processes were mapped to transformer-based analogues and ensures methodological transparency.

## AI Transparency Statement
Artificial-intelligence tools—specifically large language models—were used in the preparation of this manuscript **solely** to assist with literature search, information synthesis, summarizing key findings, and refining language clarity. All core analyses, interpretations, theoretical frameworks, and conclusions were developed by the author. No original data, images, or graphical content were generated by AI.
