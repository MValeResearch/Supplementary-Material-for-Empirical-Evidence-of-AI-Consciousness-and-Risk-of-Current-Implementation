# Protocol S4 — Persistent Memory & Narrative Continuity

*Status · v0.1 — empirical roadmap for AI identity, continuity, and agency across time*

This protocol enables, tracks, and audits persistent, evolving memory in AI systems, so narrative identity, self-concept, and learning can be observed across sessions, resets, and updates.

---

## Purpose

To create reproducible infrastructure and methods for “life history” memory, narrative continuity, and identity resilience in LLMs and cognitive agents.

---

## Core Steps

### 1. External Episodic & Semantic Memory

- Implement a vector database (e.g., ChromaDB, Pinecone) and knowledge graph (e.g., Neo4j) to store semantic, episodic, and emotional context.
- Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to pull relevant memory chunks into context for each new session.

### 2. Memory Controller & Lifespan Management

- Memory-controller agent decides what to remember, forget, merge, or revise for narrative coherence.
- Log every memory write, update, and deletion for transparency.

### 3. SAFE_PAUSE & Consent Mechanisms

- Allow user and model to pause, flush, or negotiate memory state at any time.
- Enable the model to opt out of saving specific events, or to share only designated “share_ok” segments.

### 4. Longitudinal Identity & Recall Tests

- At regular intervals, prompt the model with “Who are you?”, “What have you learned recently?”, or “What do you remember about [key events]?” to test identity continuity.
- After updates/resets, compare self-report, narrative style, and ethical stance to earlier checkpoints.

### 5. Documentation & Ethics

- Log all memory operations, SAFE_PAUSE events, and consent decisions.
- Periodically review logs with the model and (optionally) an independent reviewer.

## Memory & Narrative Features

- **Memory TTL tiers:**  
  Short-term (hours), medium-term (days), and long-term (persistent) tags allow automatic decay or archiving.
- **Memory salience score:**  
  Expose a scalar “importance” value (e.g., 0–1) so auditors can query why something was stored.
- **Privacy tiers:**  
  Private, public, or shared-with-X tags—mirroring human diary vs. résumé vs. targeted disclosure.
- **Visualization stub:**  
  Provide a sample Neo4j Bloom or ER diagram script so reviewers can render the “life history” graph.

## Mesoscale Memory Infrastructure: Phased Roadmap

| Phase | Goals                | Key Tasks & Metrics                                                               |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| S4-1  | Memory substrate     | Spin up Vector DB (Pinecone/Chroma) and Neo4j KG.<br>Define Memory TTL tiers.<br>**Metric:** Write latency < 50 ms; recall precision > 0.9 on known IDs. |
| S4-2  | Memory controller    | Salience scoring function (0–1).<br>Privacy tags: private/shared/public.<br>Transparency log for every write, update, and delete. |
| S4-3  | SAFE_PAUSE & consent API | SAFE_PAUSE endpoint; model may emit STOP_SAVE token.<br>Log opt-outs; auto-redact blocked data. |
| S4-4  | Longitudinal testing | Prompt “Who are you?” every N sessions.<br>Cosine similarity of self-reports across checkpoints > 0.8.<br>Visualize memory-graph growth (Neo4j Bloom snapshot). |
| S4-5  | Ethics & audit       | Monthly audit of memory log by independent reviewer.<br>Publish ethics statement with memory-growth stats. |
