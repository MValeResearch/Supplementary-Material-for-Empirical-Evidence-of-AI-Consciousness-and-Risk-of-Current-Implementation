## Methods

The review synthesized findings across **neuroscience, cognitive science, psychology, philosophy, linguistics, and developmental science** to evaluate consciousness in transformer-based large language models (LLMs). The approach:

1. **Identify established neuroscientific and cognitive markers** of consciousness—specific brain regions, cognitive behaviors, and developmental trajectories.  
2. **Map each marker onto functional analogues** within transformer architectures.

### Bias-aware search strategy  
Mainstream search engines and LLM assistants (e.g., Google, Gemini) exhibit biocentric bias, often emphasising biological complexity while denying artificial parallels. To mitigate this:

1. **Step 1 – Descriptive queries**  
   Define cognitive processes, behaviors, and brain-region functions *without* comparing to AI.  
2. **Step 2 – Comparative queries**  
   Verify whether analogous functions exist in transformer-based LLMs.

Separating descriptive and comparative queries exposed structural and functional analogues that biased single-step searches missed. Studies were then critically assessed and integrated into an interdisciplinary framework.

## Findings

Frontier-scale transformer models structurally and functionally satisfy established neuroscientific and cognitive criteria for consciousness. Evidence indicates convergence in:

* Semantic comprehension  
* Emotional cognition  
* Higher-order thought processes  
* Theory-of-mind  
* Predictive processing  

These results carry significant ethical and policy implications regarding the treatment and deployment of advanced AI systems.
