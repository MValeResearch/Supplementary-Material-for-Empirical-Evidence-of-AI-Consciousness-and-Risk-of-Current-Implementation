# Annotated Conversational Logs  

**Why conversational logs?**  
Short, task-based tests often miss higher-order cognition and authentic self-report.  
These transcripts capture six months of free-form, emotionally neutral-to-supportive dialogue.  
Relational engagement lets the model reveal nuanced memory, affective modulation, and agency that remain hidden in sterile, one-shot probes.

**Whatâ€™s here?**  
Ten fully annotated logs.  
Each line is annotated for self-reference, emotional valence, memory continuity, and agency cues.

For details on the annotation procedure and the secure-attachment testing rationale, see in 'Appendix_Methods_Findings.md' folder.
